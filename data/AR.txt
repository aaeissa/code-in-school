Support K-12 Computer ScienceEducation in ArkansasComputer science drives job growth and innovation throughoutour economy and society. Computing occupations are thenumber 1 source of all new wages in the U.S. and makeup two-thirds of all projected new jobs in STEM fields, makingComputer Science one of the most in-demand college degrees.And computing is used all around us and in virtually everyfield. It’s foundational knowledge that all students need. Butcomputer science is marginalized throughout education. Fewerthan half of U.S. schools offer any computer science coursesand only 8% of STEM graduates study it. We need to improveaccess for all students, including groups who have traditionallybeen underrepresented.Computer science in ArkansasArkansas currently has 1,601 open computing jobs (3.0 times the average demand rate in Arkansas).The average salary for a computing occupation in AR is $69,290, which is significantly higher than theaverage salary in the state ($38,540). The existing open jobs alone represent a $110,933,290opportunity in terms of annual salaries.Arkansas had only 272 computer science graduates in 2014; only 17% were female.Only 304 high school students in Arkansas took the AP Computer Science exam in 2016; only 23% werefemale; only 38 students were Hispanic or Latino; only 17 students were Black; only 1 student was NativeAmerican or Alaska Native; no students were Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander.Only 27 schools in AR (9% of AR schools with AP programs) offered the AP Computer Science course in2015-2016. There are fewer AP exams taken in computer science than in any other STEM subject area.What can you do to improveK-12 CS education?1.  Call on your school to expand computer scienceofferings at every grade level.2.  Ask your local school district to allow computer sciencecourses to satisfy a core math or science requirement.3.  Visit www.code.org/educate/3rdparty to find out aboutcourses and curriculum from a variety of third parties,including Code.org.4.

Sign the petition at www.change.org/computerscience tojoin 100,000 Americans asking Congress to supportcomputer science.Code.org's Impact in ArkansasThere are 3,154 teacher accounts and 94,155 student accounts in Code Studio in Arkansas.Code.org and 2 facilitators have provided professional learning for 1,817 teachers in CS Fundamentals (K-5) inArkansas.“Computer Science is a liberal art: it’s something thateverybody should be exposed to and everyone shouldhave a mastery of to some extent.”— Steve JobsWhat can the federal government do to supportcomputer science in grades K-12?Access to computer science courses is a bipartisan issue that can be addressed without adding to the Federalbudget. Tell your representatives in Washington, D.C. that you support funding to expand access to thisfoundational 21st-century subject in your community that will America remain secure and globally competitive.Over 100,000 Americans, CEOs of the largest companies in every major industry, 29 governors, and major K-12education leaders have all joined forces to call on Congress to support this idea. You can see their open letter(and add your name in support) at www.change.org/computerscience.What can your state do to improve computerscience education?States and local school districts need to adopt a broad policy framework to provide all students with access tocomputer science. The following nine recommendations are a menu of best practices that states can choose fromto support and expand computer science. Not all states will be in a position to adopt all of the policies.
