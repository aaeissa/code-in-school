Support K-12 Computer ScienceEducation in MassachusettsComputer science drives job growth and innovation throughoutour economy and society. Computing occupations are thenumber 1 source of all new wages in the U.S. and makeup two-thirds of all projected new jobs in STEM fields, makingComputer Science one of the most in-demand college degrees.And computing is used all around us and in virtually everyfield. It’s foundational knowledge that all students need. Butcomputer science is marginalized throughout education. Fewerthan half of U.S. schools offer any computer science coursesand only 8% of STEM graduates study it. We need to improveaccess for all students, including groups who have traditionallybeen underrepresented.Computer science in MassachusettsMassachusetts currently has 17,395 open computing jobs (3.0 times the average demand rate inMassachusetts).The average salary for a computing occupation in MA is $102,015, which is significantly higher than theaverage salary in the state ($59,010). The existing open jobs alone represent a $1,774,550,925opportunity in terms of annual salaries.Massachusetts had only 1,609 computer science graduates in 2014; only 21% were female.Only 2,279 high school students in Massachusetts took the AP Computer Science exam in 2016; only21% were female; only 157 students were Hispanic or Latino; only 78 students were Black; only 4 studentswere Native American or Alaska Native; no students were Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander.Only 151 schools in MA (34% of MA schools with AP programs) offered the AP Computer Science course in2015-2016. There are fewer AP exams taken in computer science than in any other STEM subject area.What can you do to improveK-12 CS education?1.  Call on your school to expand computer scienceofferings at every grade level.2.  Ask your local school district to allow computer sciencecourses to satisfy a core math or science requirement.3.  Visit www.code.org/educate/3rdparty to find out aboutcourses and curriculum from a variety of third parties,including Code.org.4.  Visit www.code.org/promote/MA to learn more aboutsupporting computer science in your state.5.  Sign the petition at www.change.org/computerscience tojoin 100,000 Americans asking Congress to supportcomputer science.Code.org's Impact in MassachusettsThere are 3,502 teacher accounts and 150,255 student accounts in Code Studio in Massachusetts.Code.org and 4 facilitators have provided professional learning for 607 teachers in CS Fundamentals (K-5) , 56teachers in Exploring Computer Science, and 5 teachers in Computer Science Principles in Massachusetts.“Computer Science is a liberal art: it’s something thateverybody should be exposed to and everyone shouldhave a mastery of to some extent.”— Steve JobsWhat can the federal government do to supportcomputer science in grades K-12?Access to computer science courses is a bipartisan issue that can be addressed without adding to the Federalbudget. Tell your representatives in Washington, D.C. that you support funding to expand access to thisfoundational 21st-century subject in your community that will America remain secure and globally competitive.Over 100,000 Americans, CEOs of the largest companies in every major industry, 29 governors, and major K-12education leaders have all joined forces to call on Congress to support this idea. You can see their open letter(and add your name in support) at www.change.org/computerscience.What can your state do to improve computerscience education?States and local school districts need to adopt a broad policy framework to provide all students with access tocomputer science. The following nine recommendations are a menu of best practices that states can choose fromto support and expand computer science. Not all states will be in a position to adopt all of the policies. Read moreabout these 9 policy ideas at https://code.org/files/Making_CS_Fundamental.pdf and see our rubric for describingstate policies at http://bit.ly/9policiesrubric. Massachusetts has not yet created a state plan for K-12 computer science. A plan that articulates the goalsfor computer science, strategies for accomplishing the goals, and timelines for carrying out the strategies isimportant for making computer science a fundamental part of a state’s education system. Massachusetts has established K-12 computer science standards. Massachusetts has allocated funding for rigorous computer science professional development and coursesupport. Massachusetts does not yet have clear certification pathways for computer science teachers. Theexpansion of K-12 computer science education is hampered by the lack of qualified computer science teachers.We can grow their ranks by creating clear, navigable, and rewarding professional paths for computer scienceteachers. Massachusetts has not yet established programs at institutions of higher education to offer computerscience to preservice teachers. The computer science teacher shortage can be addressed by exposing morepreservice teachers to computer science during their required coursework or by creating specific pathways forcomputer science teachers. Massachusetts has a dedicated computer science position in the state education authority. Massachusetts does not yet require that all secondary schools offer computer science. The state cansupport the expansion of computer science courses by adopting policies that require schools to offer acomputer science course based on rigorous standards, with appropriate implementation timelines and allowingfor remote and/or in-person courses. Massachusetts does not yet allow computer science to count for a core graduation requirement. Statesthat count computer science as a core graduation requirement see 50% more enrollment in their AP ComputerScience courses and increased participation from underrepresented minorities. Find out how other states allowcomputer science to count towards graduation at http://bit.ly/1Is6YXS. Massachusetts allows computer science to count as a core admission requirement at institutions of highereducation.Follow us!Join our efforts to give every student in every school the opportunity to learn computer science.
