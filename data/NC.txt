Support K-12 Computer ScienceEducation in North CarolinaComputer science drives job growth and innovation throughoutour economy and society. Computing occupations are thenumber 1 source of all new wages in the U.S. and makeup two-thirds of all projected new jobs in STEM fields, makingComputer Science one of the most in-demand college degrees.And computing is used all around us and in virtually everyfield. It’s foundational knowledge that all students need. Butcomputer science is marginalized throughout education. Fewerthan half of U.S. schools offer any computer science coursesand only 8% of STEM graduates study it. We need to improveaccess for all students, including groups who have traditionallybeen underrepresented.Computer science in North CarolinaNorth Carolina currently has 17,439 open computing jobs (4.7 times the average demand rate in NorthCarolina).The average salary for a computing occupation in NC is $87,246, which is significantly higher than theaverage salary in the state ($44,170). The existing open jobs alone represent a $1,521,482,994opportunity in terms of annual salaries.North Carolina had only 1,224 computer science graduates in 2014; only 20% were female.Only 1,425 high school students in North Carolina took the AP Computer Science exam in 2016; only25% were female; only 114 students were Hispanic or Latino; only 84 students were Black; only 5 studentswere Native American or Alaska Native; no students were Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander.Only 114 schools in NC (18% of NC schools with AP programs) offered the AP Computer Science course in2015-2016. There are fewer AP exams taken in computer science than in any other STEM subject area.What can you do to improveK-12 CS education?1.  Call on your school to expand computer scienceofferings at every grade level.2.  Ask your local school district to allow computer sciencecourses to satisfy a core math or science requirement.3.  Visit www.code.org/educate/3rdparty to find out aboutcourses and curriculum from a variety of third parties,including Code.org.4.

Sign the petition at www.change.org/computerscience tojoin 100,000 Americans asking Congress to supportcomputer science.Code.org's Impact in North CarolinaThere are 6,132 teacher accounts and 220,353 student accounts in Code Studio in North Carolina.Code.org, its regional partner(s) The Friday Institute, and 5 facilitators have provided professional learning for1,510 teachers in CS Fundamentals (K-5) , 26 teachers in Exploring Computer Science, and 13 teachers inComputer Science Principles in North Carolina.“Computer Science is a liberal art: it’s something thateverybody should be exposed to and everyone shouldhave a mastery of to some extent.”— Steve JobsWhat can the federal government do to supportcomputer science in grades K-12?Access to computer science courses is a bipartisan issue that can be addressed without adding to the Federalbudget. Tell your representatives in Washington, D.C. that you support funding to expand access to thisfoundational 21st-century subject in your community that will America remain secure and globally competitive.Over 100,000 Americans, CEOs of the largest companies in every major industry, 29 governors, and major K-12education leaders have all joined forces to call on Congress to support this idea. You can see their open letter(and add your name in support) at www.change.org/computerscience.What can your state do to improve computerscience education?States and local school districts need to adopt a broad policy framework to provide all students with access tocomputer science. The following nine recommendations are a menu of best practices that states can choose fromto support and expand computer science. Not all states will be in a position to adopt all of the policies. Read moreabout these 9 policy ideas at https://code.org/files/Making_CS_Fundamental.pdf and see our rubric for describingstate policies at http://bit.ly/9policiesrubric. North Carolina has not yet created a state plan for K-12 computer science. A plan that articulates the goalsfor computer science, strategies for accomplishing the goals, and timelines for carrying out the strategies isimportant for making computer science a fundamental part of a state’s education system. North Carolina does not yet have rigorous computer science standards publicly available across K-12.Computer science has often been confused with broader technology education in schools. The state couldstrengthen its computer science programs by publicly adopting discrete standards for computer sciencefocused on both the creation and use of software and computing technologies at all levels of K-12 education.These standards can be guided by the concepts, practices, and recommendations in the K-12 ComputerScience Framework, found at http://www.k12cs.org. North Carolina does not yet provide dedicated funding for rigorous computer science professionaldevelopment and course support. Although funds may be available via broader programs, the state canstrengthen its computer science programs by creating specific opportunities to bring computer science toschool districts, such as matching fund programs. North Carolina does not yet have clear certification pathways for computer science teachers. Theexpansion of K-12 computer science education is hampered by the lack of qualified computer science teachers.We can grow their ranks by creating clear, navigable, and rewarding professional paths for computer scienceteachers. North Carolina has not yet established programs at institutions of higher education to offer computerscience to preservice teachers. The computer science teacher shortage can be addressed by exposing morepreservice teachers to computer science during their required coursework or by creating specific pathways forcomputer science teachers. North Carolina does not yet have dedicated computer science positions in state or local educationauthorities. Creating a statewide computer science leadership position within the state education authority canhelp expand state-level implementation of computer science education initiatives. Similar positions at the locallevel could support districts’ expansion of course offerings and professional development. North Carolina does not yet require that all secondary schools offer computer science. The state cansupport the expansion of computer science courses by adopting policies that require schools to offer acomputer science course based on rigorous standards, with appropriate implementation timelines and allowingfor remote and/or in-person courses. North Carolina allows computer science to count for a core graduation requirement.
