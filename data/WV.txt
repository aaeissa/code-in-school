Support K-12 Computer ScienceEducation in West VirginiaComputer science drives job growth and innovation throughoutour economy and society. Computing occupations are thenumber 1 source of all new wages in the U.S. and makeup two-thirds of all projected new jobs in STEM fields, makingComputer Science one of the most in-demand college degrees.And computing is used all around us and in virtually everyfield. It’s foundational knowledge that all students need. Butcomputer science is marginalized throughout education. Fewerthan half of U.S. schools offer any computer science coursesand only 8% of STEM graduates study it. We need to improveaccess for all students, including groups who have traditionallybeen underrepresented.Computer science in West VirginiaWest Virginia currently has 1,009 open computing jobs (3.9 times the average demand rate in WestVirginia).The average salary for a computing occupation in WV is $69,461, which is significantly higher than theaverage salary in the state ($39,100). The existing open jobs alone represent a $70,086,149 opportunityin terms of annual salaries.West Virginia had only 120 computer science graduates in 2014; only 17% were female.Only 97 high school students in West Virginia took the AP Computer Science exam in 2016; only 36%were female; only 3 students were Hispanic or Latino; only 2 students were Black; no students were NativeAmerican or Alaska Native; no students were Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander.Only 16 schools in WV (13% of WV schools with AP programs) offered the AP Computer Science course in2015-2016. There are fewer AP exams taken in computer science than in any other STEM subject area.What can you do to improveK-12 CS education?1.  Call on your school to expand computer scienceofferings at every grade level.2.  Ask your local school district to allow computer sciencecourses to satisfy a core math or science requirement.3.  Visit www.code.org/educate/3rdparty to find out aboutcourses and curriculum from a variety of third parties,including Code.org.4.  Visit www.code.org/promote/WV to learn more aboutsupporting computer science in your state.5.  Sign the petition at www.change.org/computerscience tojoin 100,000 Americans asking Congress to supportcomputer science.Code.org's Impact in West VirginiaThere are 575 teacher accounts and 29,683 student accounts in Code Studio in West Virginia.“Computer Science is a liberal art: it’s something thateverybody should be exposed to and everyone shouldhave a mastery of to some extent.”— Steve JobsWhat can the federal government do to supportcomputer science in grades K-12?Access to computer science courses is a bipartisan issue that can be addressed without adding to the Federalbudget. Tell your representatives in Washington, D.C. that you support funding to expand access to thisfoundational 21st-century subject in your community that will America remain secure and globally competitive.Over 100,000 Americans, CEOs of the largest companies in every major industry, 29 governors, and major K-12education leaders have all joined forces to call on Congress to support this idea. You can see their open letter(and add your name in support) at www.change.org/computerscience.What can your state do to improve computerscience education?States and local school districts need to adopt a broad policy framework to provide all students with access tocomputer science. The following nine recommendations are a menu of best practices that states can choose fromto support and expand computer science. Not all states will be in a position to adopt all of the policies. Read moreabout these 9 policy ideas at https://code.org/files/Making_CS_Fundamental.pdf and see our rubric for describingstate policies at http://bit.ly/9policiesrubric. West Virginia has not yet created a state plan for K-12 computer science. A plan that articulates the goalsfor computer science, strategies for accomplishing the goals, and timelines for carrying out the strategies isimportant for making computer science a fundamental part of a state’s education system. West Virginia is in the process of developing K-12 computer science standards. West Virginia does not yet provide dedicated funding for rigorous computer science professionaldevelopment and course support. Although funds may be available via broader programs, the state canstrengthen its computer science programs by creating specific opportunities to bring computer science toschool districts, such as matching fund programs. West Virginia has clear certification pathways for computer science teachers. West Virginia has not yet established programs at institutions of higher education to offer computer scienceto preservice teachers. The computer science teacher shortage can be addressed by exposing morepreservice teachers to computer science during their required coursework or by creating specific pathways forcomputer science teachers. West Virginia does not yet have dedicated computer science positions in state or local educationauthorities. Creating a statewide computer science leadership position within the state education authority canhelp expand state-level implementation of computer science education initiatives. Similar positions at the locallevel could support districts’ expansion of course offerings and professional development. West Virginia requires that all secondary schools offer computer science. West Virginia allows computer science to count for a core graduation requirement. Find out how West Virginiaallows computer science to count towards graduation at http://bit.ly/1Is6YXS. West Virginia does not yet allow computer science to count as a core admission requirement at institutionsof higher education. Admission policies that do not include rigorous computer science courses as meeting acore entrance requirement, such as in mathematics or science, discourage students from taking such coursesin secondary education. State leaders can work with institutions of higher education to ensure credit andarticulation policies align with secondary school graduation requirements.Follow us!Join our efforts to give every student in every school the opportunity to learn computer science.
