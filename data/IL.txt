Support K-12 Computer ScienceEducation in IllinoisComputer science drives job growth and innovation throughoutour economy and society. Computing occupations are thenumber 1 source of all new wages in the U.S. and makeup two-thirds of all projected new jobs in STEM fields, makingComputer Science one of the most in-demand college degrees.And computing is used all around us and in virtually everyfield. It’s foundational knowledge that all students need. Butcomputer science is marginalized throughout education. Fewerthan half of U.S. schools offer any computer science coursesand only 8% of STEM graduates study it. We need to improveaccess for all students, including groups who have traditionallybeen underrepresented.Computer science in IllinoisIllinois currently has 21,948 open computing jobs (4.2 times the average demand rate in Illinois).The average salary for a computing occupation in IL is $86,131, which is significantly higher than theaverage salary in the state ($49,970). The existing open jobs alone represent a $1,890,403,188opportunity in terms of annual salaries.Illinois had only 1,471 computer science graduates in 2014; only 13% were female.Only 2,938 high school students in Illinois took the AP Computer Science exam in 2016; only 21% werefemale; only 330 students were Hispanic or Latino; only 52 students were Black; only 3 students wereNative American or Alaska Native; only 1 student was Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander.Only 123 schools in IL (17% of IL schools with AP programs) offered the AP Computer Science course in2015-2016. There are fewer AP exams taken in computer science than in any other STEM subject area.What can you do to improveK-12 CS education?1.  Call on your school to expand computer scienceofferings at every grade level.2.  Ask your local school district to allow computer sciencecourses to satisfy a core math or science requirement.3.

Tell your representatives in Washington, D.C. that you support funding to expand access to thisfoundational 21st-century subject in your community that will America remain secure and globally competitive.Over 100,000 Americans, CEOs of the largest companies in every major industry, 29 governors, and major K-12education leaders have all joined forces to call on Congress to support this idea. You can see their open letter(and add your name in support) at www.change.org/computerscience.What can your state do to improve computerscience education?States and local school districts need to adopt a broad policy framework to provide all students with access tocomputer science. The following nine recommendations are a menu of best practices that states can choose fromto support and expand computer science. Not all states will be in a position to adopt all of the policies. Read moreabout these 9 policy ideas at https://code.org/files/Making_CS_Fundamental.pdf and see our rubric for describingstate policies at http://bit.ly/9policiesrubric. Illinois has not yet created a state plan for K-12 computer science. A plan that articulates the goals forcomputer science, strategies for accomplishing the goals, and timelines for carrying out the strategies isimportant for making computer science a fundamental part of a state’s education system. Illinois does not yet have rigorous computer science standards publicly available across K-12. Computerscience has often been confused with broader technology education in schools. The state could strengthen itscomputer science programs by publicly adopting discrete standards for computer science focused on both thecreation and use of software and computing technologies at all levels of K-12 education. These standards canbe guided by the concepts, practices, and recommendations in the K-12 Computer Science Framework, foundat http://www.k12cs.org. Illinois does not yet provide dedicated funding for rigorous computer science professional development andcourse support. Although funds may be available via broader programs, the state can strengthen its computerscience programs by creating specific opportunities to bring computer science to school districts, such asmatching fund programs. Illinois has clear certification pathways for computer science teachers. Illinois has not yet established programs at institutions of higher education to offer computer science topreservice teachers. The computer science teacher shortage can be addressed by exposing more preserviceteachers to computer science during their required coursework or by creating specific pathways for computerscience teachers. Illinois does not yet have dedicated computer science positions in state or local education authorities.Creating a statewide computer science leadership position within the state education authority can help expandstate-level implementation of computer science education initiatives. Similar positions at the local level couldsupport districts’ expansion of course offerings and professional development. Illinois does not yet require that all secondary schools offer computer science. The state can support theexpansion of computer science courses by adopting policies that require schools to offer a computer sciencecourse based on rigorous standards, with appropriate implementation timelines and allowing for remoteand/or in-person courses. Illinois allows computer science to count for a core graduation requirement. Find out how Illinois allowscomputer science to count towards graduation at http://bit.ly/1Is6YXS. Illinois allows computer science to count as a core admission requirement at institutions of highereducation.Follow us!Join our efforts to give every student in every school the opportunity to learn computer science.
